# Urban-Traffic-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Dev
 
This notebook covers a simple exploratory analysis over the Behavior of the urban traffic of the city of Sao Paulo in Brazil Data Set. In addition, we shortlisted a few machine learning models to predict the Slowness in Traffic variable (0-100%). Although a very interesting dataset, its size is considerably small, limiting the models performance and the exploratory analysis. The notebook was built with self-learning purposes only, and we'll be happy to have your feedback on misunderstandings and improvements. The dataset covers 135 instances, each representing 30 minute timeframes over the week, from Monday 12/14/2009 to Friday 12/18/2009.

A special thanks to Aurelien Geron, author of Hands-On Machine Learning (O'Reilly) for the lessons that guided us through this notebook. Similarly, we thank the original owners and donors of the dataset Behavior of the urban traffic of the city of Sao Paulo in Brazil Data Set, used in this notebook: Ricardo Pinto Ferreira, Andrea Martiniano and Renato Jose Sassi.

This notebook was made by Guilherme Matunaga and Paris Mollo.
